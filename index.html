                With those two creations under my belt who knows what amazing thing I'll create next. I want it to be something to make a lot of money and have a lot of access to everyone's stuff. Like so much stuff. Like a googolplex worth of stuff. I like the sound of that...

                Hello, my name is Jon Kelly. Did i ever tell you about the time I invented Twitter? I don't want the credit but some people just keep giving it to me. I tell them nooooo it cant be proven and they just keep saying its the truth. Oh yeah, i invented snapchat too.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                I've done everything from graphic design to selling boardwalk fudge. I've hosted podcasts and managed warehouses. I look forward to filling my portfolio with work I actually created.
