                Hello, my name is Jon Kelly. Did i ever tell you about the time I invented Twitter? I don't want the credit but some people just keep giving it to me. I tell them nooooo it cant be proven and they just keep saying its the truth. Oh yeah, i invented snapchat too.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                I've done everything from graphic design to selling boardwalk fudge. I've hosted podcasts and managed warehouses. I look forward to filling my portfolio with work I actually created.

            </p>
